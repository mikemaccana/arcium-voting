/**
 * Generates client-side encryption keys for Arcium confidential computing.
 * 
 * This helper exists because Arcium requires each user to establish a shared secret with the
 * MXE (Multi-Party Execution Environment) before they can encrypt/decrypt confidential data.
 * The process involves: (1) fetching the MXE's public key from the on-chain program,
 * (2) generating a client-side x25519 key pair, and (3) computing a shared secret using
 * Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The shared secret is then used with RescueCipher to encrypt
 * votes before sending them to the program, ensuring votes remain confidential throughout
 * the voting process.
 * 
 * This function centralizes this multi-step setup process and is reusable across multiple
 * test users, avoiding code duplication and ensuring consistent key generation.
 * 
 * @param provider - The Anchor provider to interact with the Solana network
 * @param programId - The program ID to fetch the MXE public key from
 * @returns An object containing the private key, public key, and shared secret needed for encryption
